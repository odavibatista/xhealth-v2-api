Welcome! This repository is the back-end stack of a previous project of mine, [XHealth Gyms](https://github.com/odavibatista/onebitcode-hackathon-2).

## About  <a name="about"></a>
The first version of this project was a monolythic Angular app that lacked an API and a proper database for its data storage. This version is intended to be a complete rewrite of the project; not only making it a full-stack application, but also using top-notch technologies and practices to give it a new life and - at the same time - showcase my new skills in software engineering and development.

The back-end was chosen to be built with NestJS, since the app's size and scalability would be way bigger than the "previous" version and by working with NestJS and a modular clean architecture, it would be easier to build the app and maintain its patterns in its automated tests, as well as in its code quality and readability. As most of the entities are co-related, Prisma was chosen as its ORM, since it allows an automatic generation of sister-entities.

Redis was chosen as the cache provider, in a way of implementing an efficient way of saving data to be fetched without stressing the application, as well as to avoid latency issues between regions.

## Installation
In order to use the database locally, you require a Redis database to be used as the application's cache. The app provides support for both local environments (such as Docker Redis containers or the Redis CLI) or the Redis' dedicated databases.

If you're using a dedicated Redis DB, you should define its configs at `./.env` in the following way (mock values are being used):

```
NODE_ENV=production
...
# Redis Cache Production Settings
REDIS_PRODUCTION_HOST="hostname-redis-example"
REDIS_PRODUCTION_PORT=6379
REDIS_PRODUCTION_USER=default
REDIS_PRODUCTION_PASSWORD=root
```

If you're going for Redis CLI or a Redis Image being run on Docker, the application won't require user and password to authenticate you in the database. It's enough to only set the following variables:

```
NODE_ENV=development | local | test
...
# Redis Cache Settings
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

Since the application uses AES-256 cryptography, it's mandatory to set it's two keys. You can generate them [here](https://acte.ltd/utils/randomkeygen), then set them in the `./.env` file the following way:

```
# Cryptography Settings
CRYPTO_SECRET=(use the 'Basic 8' generated key)
CRYPTO_IV=(use the 'Basic 16' generated key)
```

As for the JWT, the `APP_SECRET` variable should be set. Any value will do, but I personally recommend you to use a key provided by the generator above.

```
APP_SECRET=something_nice
```

As for the last configs, you shall set any PORT you desire, as long as it's not 3000 or the port being used by your local front-end application.

Since we're using Prisma, you only need to set the DB's connection string in the `DATABASE_URL` variable. The application supports both PostgreSQL and MySQL, so you can choose any of them. The connection string should be set in the following way:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"
```

Once everything's set, you can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, you can run the application in development mode by running:

```
npx prisma generate

npx prisma migrate <migration-name>

npm run start:dev
```

After that, the API should be up and running. To access its Swagger documentation, you only need to add the `/swagger` path after the API's URL on your browser. For example, if you're running the API on `http://localhost:5000`, you should access `http://localhost:5000/swagger`.
